1) when the bot is started there should be a welcome message and 4 replykeyboardbuttons
   they are: For Buying, For Selling, List Orders, and Rules and guidelines(with paper emoji)

2) when clicked on the 'For Buying' it should send a replykeyboard that opens mini app(as a placeholder it should just open google)

3) when clicked on 'For selling' it should send a replykeyboard which again is google.com as a placeholder

4) Rules and guidelines should send telegraph article of the rules and guidelines

*the list of commands are as follows: /list-orders(removed from the replykeyboard), /start, /acount 
   -the /about will show developer username which is @kbmati9 for contact, and other info
* restructure the replykeyboard buttons so that Foy buying, For Selling takes the first row, but the longer text have a dedicated second row
